# DPScope

I bought a DPScope for my electronic projects, but quickly found out it had only Windows software, but a relatively simple serial protocol.

This software aims to pull data out of the device on any platform supported by matplotlib and PySerial.

## Usage

Install [usb serial driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)

    $ python dpscope/gui.py
